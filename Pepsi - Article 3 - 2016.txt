Earnings rise in 2Q16
PepsiCo’s adjusted EPS increased by 2.3% in 2Q16, compared with a growth rate of 7.2% in 1Q16 and -0.2% in 2Q15. The growth in PepsiCo’s earnings in 2Q16 was driven by improved margins and the strong performance of the company’s North America business. We’ll discuss the company’s margins in part four of this series and its North America business in part three of this series.

In 2Q16, currency headwinds impacted PepsiCo’s EPS by 4%. Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo have a strong international presence, which exposes them to significant currency fluctuations. In fiscal 2015, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola generated 44% and 54% of their revenues, respectively, from international operations. Smaller nonalcoholic beverage companies Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) and Monster Beverage (MNST) generated 11.3% and 21.3%, respectively, of their fiscal 2015 net sales outside the United States.

Aside from currency headwinds, the deconsolidation of PepsiCo’s Venezuelan operations had a three-percentage-point impact on PepsiCo’s 2Q16 adjusted EPS. The iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (KXI) has a 4.4% exposure to PepsiCo.
