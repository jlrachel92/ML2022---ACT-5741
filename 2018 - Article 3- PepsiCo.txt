PepsiCo, Inc. (Nasdaq: PEP) exceeded expectations on Tuesday morning when it reported its second-quarter earnings. PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay snack business was again the shining star in the quarter, but analysts say the North American beverage business also seems to finally be improving as well.

PepsiCo reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 on revenue of $16.09 billion. Both numbers topped consensus analyst estimates of $1.52 and $16.04 billion, respectively. Revenue was up 2.4 percent in the quarter. Organic revenue growth, which does not include the impact of currency fluctuations, was up 2.6 percent.

“We are pleased with our results for the second quarter and we remain on track to achieve the financial targets we set out at the beginning of the year,” CEO Indra Nooyi says in a statement.
