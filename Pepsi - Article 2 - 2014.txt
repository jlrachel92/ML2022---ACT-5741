PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi is excited about the company's 2013 performance, but are investors?
PepsiCo oozed confidence in its earnings report Thursday. The company announced plans to return more cash to shareholders, stood up to an activist investor and predicted stronger growth in the future. But investors aren't buying it. PepsiCO shares were down close to 3% in morning trading to $79.14.

PepsiCo reported $20.1 billion in fourth quarter revenue, up 1% from the prior year but slightly below Wall Street analysts' $20.2 billion revenue estimate. For the full year the company reported $66.4 billion in revenue, which was similarly up 1% and $100 million short of Street expectations.

At $1.7 billion and $6.7 billion fourth quarter and full year net income grew 5% and 9% respectively. Fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.12, up 6% from the same period in the prior year and ahead of the Street's $1.03 estimate. Full year earnings were $4.32, up 10% from 2012 and 7 cents above consensus.


“We are pleased to report that PepsiCo achieved its financial goals for 2013, despite continued challenging and volatile macroeconomic conditions around the globe," said CEO Indra Nooyi in a statement. “We look ahead to 2014 with confidence that our business is positioned to continue to perform well and to generate attractive returns for our shareholders."

In a show of confidence, Nooyi also announced that PepsiCo will increase its cash returns to shareholders to $8.7 billion in 2014. The company will increase its annual dividend by 15% from $2.27 per share to $2.62 per share and expects to at about $5 billion to its share buyback program.

Looking ahead the company expects 7% earnings per share growth in 2014 from its core earnings per share of $4.37, which excludes the negative  impact of commodity hedges, restructuring charges and currency devaluation in Venezuela, as well as the positive impact of tax settlements. The company expects revenue to grow in the mid-single digits over 2013.


In another show of morale, PepsiCO announced that it will not be making any changes to the structure of its North American beverage business. Last summer billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz suggested Pepsi should acquire Mondelez International -- which spun off from Kraft in 2012 -- before dividing into separate beverage and snack businesses. With that scenario appearing unlikely Peltz argued Pepsi should divide its existing beverage and snack divisions. Pepsi's announcement Thursday shelved that scenario.

In the fourth quarter Pepsi's snacks division volume grew 3% and brought in $7.9 billion in revenue. Beverage volume gained 1% and contributed $12.2 billion to the company's overall revenue.
